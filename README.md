People vs Pavement

People vs Pavement is an interactive, single-page website that explores the social, emotional, and practical consequences of living in car-dependent suburbia. Designed to be engaging rather than preachy, the project uses humor, sarcasm, and narrative storytelling to help users recognize how car-centric infrastructure shapes daily life—often in ways we accept without question.

The experience is intentionally scroll-based, allowing users to move linearly through the content, while also providing top-level navigation to jump between sections. Each section is meant to feel lightweight and accessible on its own, but more powerful in sequence.

Concept & Experience

The site walks users through a series of interactive modules, each highlighting a different aspect of car dependency:

Car-Dependency Bingo
Users begin by checking off familiar features of car-dependent suburbia—long distances, unsafe roads, lack of sidewalks—to see how deeply these patterns affect their own lives.

Sarcastic Chatbot
A deliberately blunt chatbot answers pre-selected questions about mobility and safety with dry, sarcastic responses (e.g., “Can I bike safely?” → “No 💓”), using humor to underline serious constraints.

A Day in the Life
A narrative section following a teenager navigating daily life in a car-dependent suburb, illustrating how limited transportation affects independence, social life, and opportunity.

Disproportionate Impacts
A breakdown of how car-centric design affects specific groups—children, teenagers, elderly individuals, low-income communities, and people with disabilities—highlighting inequities baked into infrastructure.

The Excuse Generator
A button-driven feature that cycles through common justifications for car-dependent suburbia, exposing how normalized and recycled these arguments often are.

Why This Project Exists
A closing reflection explaining the motivation behind the project and tying the experience together with a clear, intentional conclusion.

Audience

This project is primarily for people currently living in car-dependent suburbs, especially those who may feel frustrated by mobility constraints but haven’t had language or framing to describe why. It is not aimed at urban planners or policy experts, but at everyday users experiencing these systems firsthand.

Tech Stack

Frontend: React (plain React with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)

Architecture: Single-page, scroll-based experience

Deployment: Vercel

The technical implementation is intentionally simple to keep the focus on storytelling, interaction, and user experience rather than complex infrastructure.

Live Site

The project is deployed and accessible online:

Call to Action

Car-dependent suburbia isn’t just an aesthetic or lifestyle choice—it’s an infrastructure decision with real consequences. If parts of this site felt familiar, frustrating, or uncomfortably accurate, that reaction is the point. Question what you’ve normalized, notice who is excluded by default, and consider how different design choices could create safer, more independent, and more humane places to live.

Status

This project is an evolving, live web experience. Future iterations may expand interactivity, refine storytelling, or incorporate additional perspectives, but the core goal remains the same: making invisible infrastructure visible.
